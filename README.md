# Pre-ARENA

Learning material I made as a pre-requisite warmup before doing [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/) for people at the [Recurse Center (RC)](https://www.recurse.com/).

This brushes on basic topics:
- vectorized tensor manipulations (e.g. `.sum()` / `.max()` / `.mean()` / `.cat()` / ...)
- embeddings (word2vec / PCA)
- a cute implem of Conway's game of life
